A SERGEANT OF THE LAW, wary and wise, That often had y-been at the Parvis, <26> There was also, full rich of excellence. Discreet he was, and of great reverence: He seemed such, his wordes were so wise, Justice he was full often in assize, By patent, and by plein* commission; For his science, and for his high renown, Of fees and robes had he many one. So great a purchaser was nowhere none. All was fee simple to him, in effect His purchasing might not be in suspect* Nowhere so busy a man as he there was And yet he seemed busier than he was In termes had he case' and doomes* all That from the time of King Will. were fall. Thereto he could indite, and make a thing There coulde no wight *pinch at* his writing. And every statute coud* he plain by rote He rode but homely in a medley* coat, Girt with a seint* of silk, with barres small; Of his array tell I no longer tale.

A FRANKELIN was in this company; White was his beard, as is the daisy. Of his complexion he was sanguine. Well lov'd he in the morn a sop in wine. To liven in delight was ever his won, For he was Epicurus' owen son, That held opinion, that plein delight Was verily felicity perfite. An householder, and that a great, was he; Saint Julian he was in his country. His bread, his ale, was alway after one; A better envined man was nowhere none; Withoute bake-meat never was his house, Of fish and flesh, and that so plenteous, It snowed in his house of meat and drink, Of alle dainties that men coulde think. After the sundry seasons of the year, So changed he his meat and his soupere. Full many a fat partridge had he in mew, And many a bream, and many a luce in stew Woe was his cook, but if his sauce were Poignant and sharp, and ready all his gear. His table dormant in his hall alway Stood ready cover'd all the longe day. At sessions there was he lord and sire. Full often time he was knight of the shire An anlace, and a gipciere all of silk, Hung at his girdle, white as morning milk. A sheriff had he been, and a countour Was nowhere such a worthy vavasour.

An HABERDASHER, and a CARPENTER, A WEBBE, a DYER, and a TAPISER, Were with us eke, cloth'd in one livery, Of a solemn and great fraternity. Full fresh and new their gear y-picked was. Their knives were y-chaped not with brass, But all with silver wrought full clean and well, Their girdles and their pouches every deal. Well seemed each of them a fair burgess, To sitten in a guild-hall, on the dais.  Evereach, for the wisdom that he can, Was shapely for to be an alderman. For chattels hadde they enough and rent, And eke their wives would it well assent: And elles certain they had been to blame. It is full fair to be y-clep'd madame, And for to go to vigils all before, And have a mantle royally y-bore.
