# Change Log
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
This project aims to adhere to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

## [3.1.x]
### Fixed
 - Potential file corruption caused by automatic retries as a result of
   [503 responses](https://github.com/joyent/java-manta/issues/295)
   when utilizing client-side encryption with regular PUT requests.
 - MPU finalization meant it was impossible to retry last part in case of
   [503 responses](https://github.com/joyent/java-manta/issues/297).
 - Object content verification of standard PUT requests was being
   skipped if the server [omitted the computed MD5](https://github.com/joyent/java-manta/issues/298)
   from the response.

## [3.1.5] - 2017-07-28
### Fixed
 - MPU retries still [causing file corruption](https://github.com/joyent/java-manta/issues/290)
   when server responds with 503 Service Unavailable. Apache HttpClient code path audited to ensure
   no other automatic retries can occur.

## [3.1.4] - 2017-07-21
### Changed
 - The heuristics for guessing Content-Type have been adjusted to give
   [more consistent](https://github.com/joyent/java-manta/issues/276)
   results across platforms.
### Fixed
 - When using encryption in combination with Multipart Uploads,
   [automatic retries](https://github.com/joyent/java-manta/issues/284) triggered by the underlying HTTP
   library could cause file corruption. In case of a network error automatically certain requests would be retried
   transparently (e.g. those backed by `File`s and `byte[]` data). This caused authentication and encryption state
   erroneously include the partial content from the initial request. As a result of this fix encrypted MPU operations
   will utilize the BouncyCastle cryptography library even when libnss (PKCS#11) is installed.

## [3.1.3] - 2017-06-29
### Fixed
 - [`Digest` not reset in DigestedEntity](https://github.com/joyent/java-manta/pull/280)
   leading to `MantaChecksumFailedException` when the entity is reused during automatic retry.
 - [MantaChecksumFailedException](https://github.com/joyent/java-manta/pull/275)
   lacking exception context.

## [3.1.2] - 2017-06-22
### Fixed
 - [`InputStream` left open in EncryptingEntity and EncryptingPartEntity](https://github.com/joyent/java-manta/pull/264)
   leading to space from deleted files not being reclaimed until JVM shutdown.

## [3.1.1] - 2017-06-14
### Changed
 - Added additional error context information for IOExceptions thrown
   during read() in encrypted streams.
### Fixed
 - [MantaClient.move() does not support moving a file to a non-existent directory](https://github.com/joyent/java-manta/issues/256)
   This fix optionally allows users to recursively create a destination directory 
   structure on move(). This is useful for supporting third-party APIs/libraries
   that use this pattern due to a S3 first design. 
 - Resolve issue where
   [MantaClient.getAsInputStream().close() throws MantaIOException](https://github.com/joyent/java-manta/issues/250)
   for encrypted objects with trailing HMAC. Infrequently an issue could occur where
   less bytes than requested were read and the stream was left in a bad state.
   This would prevent the underlying connection from being returned to the connection pool.
 - Exception contexts now [include SDK version.](https://github.com/joyent/java-manta/issues/254)

## [3.1.0] - 2017-06-07

Several related URL encoding bugs have been fixed.  Objects with
non-alphanumeric characters created by java-manta may have been
created with unexpected encoding characters.  Only the object names
were affected, not the content.

### Changed
 - Paths with URL unsafe characters are now encoded correctly.
   Previously the
   [space character was being transformed](https://github.com/joyent/java-manta/issues/229)
   into a plus (`+`) character.  So a PUT to the Manta object
   `/user/stor/Hello World.txt`, would instead create
   `/user/stor/Hello+World.txt`.
 - All `MantaClient` operations now
   [consistently encode](https://github.com/joyent/java-manta/issues/230),
   and `MantaObject.getPath` always returns the original (not encoded)
   path.
 - Recursive directory creation will no longer
   [encode the path twice](https://github.com/joyent/java-manta/issues/231).
 - Gracefully handle missing JCE Unlimited Strength Policy by [only enabling stronger ciphers when
   they are allowed by the runtime](https://github.com/joyent/java-manta/issues/242).
   Installing the Unlimited Policy files where necessary is still strongly recommended.

## [3.0.0] - 2017-04-06
### Changed
 - Upgraded HTTP Signatures library to 4.0.1.
 - Moved configuration validation into a static method on ConfigContext.
 - Manta specific content-types are now contained in `MantaContentTypes`.
 - MantaClient.close() no longer throws Exception.
 - Liberalized boolean parsing in configuration - true, t, T, yes, and 1 are equal true.
 - Job related classes have been moved to the com.joyent.manta.client.jobs package.
 - In `BaseChainedConfigContext`, `setHttpsCiphers` has been renamed to 
   `setHttpsCipherSuites` to be in alignment with the getter of a similar name.
 - Request IDs are now generated using time-based UUIDs. 
### Added
 - Added version information to user agent and debug output. 
 - Added simple CLI to use for debugging.

## [2.7.1] - 2016-11-11
### Added
 - Added id getter to MantaJobBuilder.Run. 
### Fixed
 - [Setting content type or metadata headers for multipart upload doesn't work](https://github.com/joyent/java-manta/issues/129)

## [2.7.0] - 2016-11-10
### Changed
 - Added `set -o pipefail` to multipart upload jobs so that we catch job failure
   states explicitly.
 - We now throw exceptions when ABORTED and UNKNOWN upload states are encountered
   when executing MantaMultipartManager.waitForCompletion().
 - We now explicitly handle InterruptedExceptions on MantaClient.close() by
   not exiting early and continuing to close all of the dangling resources.
 - Added check for SHA256 fingerprints. We error and display a message to inform
   the user to use a MD5 fingerprint for the time being.
 - We now store the multipart upload job id on the metadata of the metadata 
   object which allows us to get the job id without doing a listing.
