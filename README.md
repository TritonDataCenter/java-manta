# Java Manta Client SDK

[java-manta](http://joyent.github.com/java-manta) is a community-maintained Java
SDK for interacting with Joyent's Manta system.

## Projects Using the Java Manta Client SDK

* [Apache Commons VFS Manta Provider (Virtual File System)](https://github.com/joyent/commons-vfs-manta)
* [Hadoop Filesystem Driver for Manta](https://github.com/joyent/hadoop-manta)
* [Manta Logback Rollover](https://github.com/dekobon/manta-logback-rollover)
* [COSBench Adaptor for Manta - Object Store Benchmarks](https://github.com/joyent/cosbench-manta)

## Installation

### Requirements
* [Java 1.8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) or higher.
* [Maven 3.3.x](https://maven.apache.org/)
* [Java Cryptography Extension](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jce8-download-2133166.html)

#### CLI Requirements

Add [BouncyCastle](http://www.bouncycastle.org/latest_releases.html) as a security provider
 1. Edit "$JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/java.securityâ€¨" Add an entry for BouncyCastle  
 `security.provider.11=org.bouncycastle.jce.provider.BouncyCastleProvider`
 2. Copy bc*.jar to $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/ext

### Using Maven
Add the latest java-manta dependency to your Maven `pom.xml`.

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.joyent.manta</groupId>
    <artifactId>java-manta</artifactId>
    <version>LATEST</version>
</dependency>
```

Note: Users are expected to use the same version across sub-packages, e.g. using
`com.joyent.manta:java-manta-client:3.0.0` with
`com.joyent.manta:java-manta-client-kryo-serialization:3.1.0` is not supported.

### From Source
If you prefer to build from source, you'll also need
[Maven](https://maven.apache.org/), and then invoke:

``` bash
# mvn package
```

Which will compile the jar to ./targets/java-manta-version.jar. You can then
add it as a dependency to your Java project.

If you want to skip running of the test suite, use the `-DskipTests` property.

## Configuration

Configuration parameters take precedence from left to right - values on the
left are overridden by values on the right.

* `manta.key_id`: ( **MANTA_KEY_ID**)
The fingerprint for the public key used to access the manta service.
* `manta.key_path` ( **MANTA_KEY_PATH**)
The name of the file that will be loaded for the account used to access the manta service.
* `manta.key_content` ( **MANTA_KEY_CONTENT**)
The content of the private key as a string. This is an alternative to `manta.key_path`. Both
`manta.key_path` and can't be specified at the same time `manta.key_content`.

to Manta and then checks it against the result returned by Manta.
* `manta.upload_buffer_size` (**MANTA_UPLOAD_BUFFER_SIZE**)
The initial amount of bytes to attempt to load into memory when uploading a stream. If the
entirety of the stream fits within the number of bytes of this value, then the
contents of the buffer are directly uploaded to Manta in a retryable form.

enum type indicating that authenticating encryption verification is either Mandatory or Optional.
* `manta.encryption_key_path` (**MANTA_ENCRYPTION_KEY_PATH**)
The path on the local filesystem or a URI understandable by the JVM indicating the
location of the private key used to perform client-side encryption. If this value is
non-null, then no other encryption key values can be non-null.
* `manta.encryption_key_bytes`
The private key used to perform client-side encryption as a byte array. If this value is

If this value is non-null, then no other encryption key values can be non-null.

Below is an example of using all of the defaults and only setting the `manta.user` and `manta.key_id`.

```java
ConfigContext defaultConfig = new DefaultsConfigContext();
ConfigContext customConfig = new StandardConfigContext()
    .setMantaKeyId("d4:18:cc:34:43:a8:5a:aa:76:1c:35:36:ba:08:1e:aa")
    .setMantaUser("test-user");
ConfigContext config = new ChainedConfigContext(defaultConfig, customConfig);
```

## Accounts, Usernames and Subusers
Joyent's SmartDataCenter account implementation is such that you can have a
subuser as a dependency upon a user. This is part of SmartDataCenter's [RBAC
implementation](https://docs.joyent.com/public-cloud/rbac/users). A subuser
is a user with a unique username that is joined with the account holder's
username. Typically, this is in the format of "user/subuser".

Within the Java Manta library, we refer to the account name as the entire
string used to login - "user/subuser". When we use the term user it is in
reference to the "user" portion of the account name and when we use the term
subuser, it is in reference to the subuser portion of the account name.

The notable exception is that in the configuration passed into the library,
we have continued to use the terminology *Manta user* to refer to the
account name because of historic compatibility concerns.

## Usage

You'll need a manta login, an associated key, and its corresponding key
fingerprint.  

You will then create or use an implementation of `ConfigContext` to set up
your configuration. Once you have an instance of your configuration class,
you will then construct a `MantaClient` instance. The `MantaClient` class
is intended to be used per Manta account. It is thread-safe and you should
share one instance across multiple threads.

For detailed usage instructions consult the provided javadoc and examples.

### General Examples
 
* [Get request and client setup](java-manta-examples/src/main/java/SimpleClient.java)
* [Multipart upload](java-manta-examples/src/main/java/ServerMultipart.java)
* [Client-side Encryption](java-manta-examples/src/main/java/SimpleClientEncryption.java)

### Job Examples

Jobs can be created directly with the `MantaClient` class or they can be created
using the `MantaJobBuilder` class. `MantaJobBuilder` provides a fluent interface
that allows for an easier API for job creation and it provides a number of
useful functions for common use cases.

* [Jobs using MantaClient](java-manta-examples/src/main/java/JobsWithMantaClient.java)
* [Jobs using MantaJobBuilder](java-manta-examples/src/main/java/JobsWithMantaJobBuilder.java)

For more examples, check the included integration tests.

### Logging

The SDK utilizes [slf4j](http://www.slf4j.org/), and logging can be configured 
using a SLF4J implementation. Apache HTTP Client is bundled as a shaded artifact 
as well as an Apache Commons Logger adaptor to SLF4J so Apache HTTP Client logs
will also be output via SLF4J.

## Client-side Encryption

In order to enable client side encryption for downloading and decrypting encrypted files, please set the following 
system properties. Please consult the [Configuration]() for the corresponding environment variable.
 
- `manta.client_encryption` - set to `true`
- `manta.encryption_key_bytes_base64` or `manta.encryption_key_bytes`

Additionally, you should set the following system properties to support encrypting and uploading files using client-side
encryption.

- `manta.encryption_algorithm`
- `manta.encryption_key_id`

Below is a table of each of the supported encryption algorithms and the features they provide.

| Algorithm                            | Range Requests                     | Authenticated Encryption       |
|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| AES128/GCM/NoPadding                 | No                                 | Yes                            |
| AES192/GCM/NoPadding                 | No                                 | Yes                            |
| AES256/GCM/NoPadding                 | No                                 | Yes                            |
|                                      |                                    |                                |
| AES128/CTR/NoPadding                 | Yes                                | No                             |
| AES192/CTR/NoPadding                 | Yes                                | No                             |
| AES256/CTR/NoPadding                 | Yes                                | No                             |
|                                      |                                    |                                |
| AES128/CBC/PKCS5Padding              | No                                 | No                             |
| AES192/CBC/PKCS5Padding              | No                                 | No                             |
| AES256/CBC/PKCS5Padding              | No                                 | No                             |

*Note* that all algorithms will honor the `manta.encryption_auth_mode` setting. 

*Note* that any non-authenticated encryption algorithm will have an HMAC generated to
authenticate that ciphertext was not modified.

*Note* each instance of a MantaClient will only support the encryption/decryption for the algorithm configured for that instance.
 

### Improving Encryption Performance

#### Enabling libnss Support via PKCS11

[Libnss](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/NSS) can be used with 
[PKCS11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PKCS_11) to provide a native code interface for encryption 
functions. The SDK will detect if libnss is installed via PKCS11 and prefer it over
the Legion of the Bouncy Castle library if it is available.

To add libnss support to your JVM, you will need to locate libnss on your system. Then you will
need to add a configuration file that will be referenced by your JVM. There is documentation
on the install process [available online](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/security/p11guide.html), 
but not much guidance on what to do per distro / operating system.

Below is a list of distros / operating systems and the packages and locations of
libnss.

**Ubuntu**
Debian Package: `libnss3`
Library Location: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu 

**CentOS**
Yum Package: `nss`
Library Location: /usr/lib64

**MacOS**
Homebrew Package: `nss`
Library Location: /usr/local/opt/nss/lib
 
**SmartOS**
Pkgsrc Package: `nss`
Library Location: /opt/local/lib/nss

Once you have installed libnss and have located it's path, you will need to add a configuration
file to your system. The path doesn't matter, but for the example's sake, we will give it a
path of `/etc/nss.cfg`.

The file would have the following contents if you were on Ubuntu:
```
name = NSS
nssLibraryDirectory = /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu
nssDbMode = noDb
attributes = compatibility
```

Make sure that the name field is `NSS` because the SDK will only use the library if that specific
name is set. Next, edit the following file: `$JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/java.security`

Find the lines specifying security providers. It should look something like:
```
security.provider.1=sun.security.provider.Sun
security.provider.2=sun.security.rsa.SunRsaSign
security.provider.3=sun.security.ec.SunEC
security.provider.4=com.sun.net.ssl.internal.ssl.Provider
security.provider.5=com.sun.crypto.provider.SunJCE
security.provider.6=sun.security.jgss.SunProvider
security.provider.7=com.sun.security.sasl.Provider
security.provider.8=org.jcp.xml.dsig.internal.dom.XMLDSigRI
security.provider.9=sun.security.smartcardio.SunPCSC
```

Now, add a line in front of the first provider and make it provider number one,
then appropriately increment the other providers:

```
security.provider.1=sun.security.pkcs11.SunPKCS11 /etc/nss.cfg
security.provider.2=sun.security.provider.Sun
security.provider.3=sun.security.rsa.SunRsaSign
security.provider.4=sun.security.ec.SunEC
security.provider.5=com.sun.net.ssl.internal.ssl.Provider
security.provider.6=com.sun.crypto.provider.SunJCE
security.provider.7=sun.security.jgss.SunProvider
security.provider.8=com.sun.security.sasl.Provider
security.provider.9=org.jcp.xml.dsig.internal.dom.XMLDSigRI
security.provider.10=sun.security.smartcardio.SunPCSC
```

Once this is complete, you should now have libnss providing your cryptographic
functions.

#### Enabling Native FastMD5 Support

The Java Manta SDK uses [Timothy W Macinta's Fast MD5](http://www.twmacinta.com/myjava/fast_md5.php)
implementation internally to perform MD5 checksum operations. By default, the
SDK uses the pure Java MD5 implementation which is faster than the default
JDK implementation for large amounts of data. If the default performance
provided by the SDK is insufficient, native MD5 implementation libraries can
be loaded via JNI.

To get a native library for your system, [download the library](http://www.twmacinta.com/myjava/fast_md5.php#download) and choose the share object library that is appropriate for
your system (hint: they are contained in the `./build/` directory). The easiest
way to get up and running is to copy the library to a path that makes sense 
for your application and then when you load your application pass the following
Java system property to your application indicating the path to the native 
library:

```
java -Dcom.twmacinta.util.MD5.NATIVE_LIB_FILE=/opt/myapp/lib/arch/linux_amd64/MD5.so
```

You can also place multiple files in a directory structure and have the FastMD5
library automatically choose the right library for your platform. The details
for getting are best described in the [FastMD5 Javadocs](http://www.twmacinta.com/myjava/fast_md5_javadocs/). 

## Server-side Multipart Upload

Manta supports multipart upload for dividing large files into many smaller parts 
and uploading them to Manta, where they can be assembled. The design for the 
server-side multipart upload is specified in 
[RFD 65](https://github.com/joyent/rfd/tree/master/rfd/0065). The Java SDK
implements an interface to make using server-side multipart uploading 
straightforward. The strategy to use for multipart upload is listed below.

1. Create a MantaClient instance.
2. Create an instance of ServerSideMultipartManager passing in the instance of 
   MantaClient to the constructor.
3. Initiate an upload to the full path where the final object should be stored.
4. Upload each part using the ServerSideMultipartUpload object created in the 
   previous step. The order that parts are uploaded does not matter,
   what does matter is that each part has the appropriate part number specified.
5. Execute `complete` to commit the parts to the object on the server. At this 
   point the server will assembly the final object.

An example application is provided in the java-manta-examples module, named 
ServerMultipart, to help illustrate the workflow.

## Encrypted Multipart Upload

When using client-side encryption with multipart upload there are some 
additional restrictions imposed on the implementor of the SDK:

* Uploaded parts must be uploaded in sequential order (e.g. part 1, 
  part 2, ...).
* Different parts can not be uploaded between different JVMs.
* At this time only the cipher / mode AES/CTR is supported.


## Client-side Encryption with Server-side Multipart Upload

The workflow for using client-side encryption with server-side
multipart upload is similar to the server-side multipart upload
without client-side encryption.  As an additional constraint, you
parts must be uploaded serially and sequentially. This is required by
the underlying cipher implementations.

You will need to configure an instance of MantaClient using the
settings you would for client-side encryption, namely setting
`manta.client_encryption` to `true` and configuring the cipher and
encryption key.  Additionally, you need to create an instance of
`EncryptedServerSideMultipartManager`, which should be reused, for
uploading the various file parts and assembling the final file.

An example application is provided in the java-manta-examples module, named ClientEncryptionServerMultipart, to help illustrate the workflow.


## Subuser Difficulties

If you are using subusers, be sure to specify the Manta account name as `user/subuser`.
Also, a common problem is that you haven't granted the subuser access to the
path within Manta. Typically this is done via the [Manta CLI Tools](https://apidocs.joyent.com/manta/commands-reference.html)
using the [`mchmod` command](https://github.com/joyent/node-manta/blob/master/docs/man/mchmod.md).
This can also be done by adding roles on the `MantaHttpHeaders` object.

For example:

```bash
mchmod +subusername /user/stor/my_directory
```

## Contributions

Contributions welcome! Please read the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) document for details
on getting started.

### Testing

When running the integration tests, you will need an active account on the Joyent public
cloud or a private Manta instance. To test:
```
# Assuming you have already set your environment variables and/or system properties
mvn test
```

By default, the test suite invokes the java manta client against the live manta
service.  In order to run the test suite, you will need to specify environment
variables, system properties or TestNG parameters to tell the library how to
authenticate against Manta.

While the Java Cryptography Extensions are expected to be installed, it is possible to
run a subset of the test suite by adding `-DexcludedGroups=unlimited-crypto`, e.g.:
```
mvn test -DexcludedGroups=unlimited-crypto
```
